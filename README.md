# Ann Mochinski's Final Project for IGME-230

This is my final project respository. The completed file will be linked from [my website](http://people.rit.edu/am2317/igme230/) when it's complete.

My Plans
My plan is to illustrate three different weather types. The first illustration will be a rainbow. When you go into the page, the rainbow will come out with all six different colors, which are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple, and will swift the curve to the other side.  The background color will be dark gray.  The second illustration will be clouds.  The clouds will move slowly across the screen.  The background color will be sky blue.  The third illustration will be rain. Few blue drops of water will come down from the top of the screen to hit the ground into splashes. The background color will be light pink.  I am planning to add the navigation bars, which are rainbow, clouds, rain, and documentation, on top for the users to click any tabs they want to get into the page.

What I need to learn and how
More about SVG and animations
jQuery
I plan to use the web to learn more about the above to help with the project.
