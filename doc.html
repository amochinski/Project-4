        <h3>About</h3>
		<h5>
			I added an introduction story for the user to know they are feel welcomed.
            I decided to add some fun facts about rainbow, clouds, and rain.
            I added the button and made the text change when button is clicked using javascript.
		</h5>
        <h3>Rainbow</h3>
		<h5>
			I found this cool animation from online.
            I removed everything that was in the background, such as grass and sky, and then I added black.
            The rainbow used to show half of it but I changed it to show it the whole thing.
            I added one more color to show six strips instead of five strips.
            It connects with CSS with colors and the movement of going in circles.
		</h5>
        <h3>Clouds</h3>
		<h5>
			The clouds were pretty simple but challeging to make them.
            I added light blue as the background color.
            I found it online where it was only a few clouds, however I added five more clouds to show more clouds moving.
            I made the clouds to have various sizes.
		</h5>
        <h3>Rain</h3>
		<h5>
			Rain is really challeging but I found a pretty simple one from online.
            I changed the background color to palegreen.
            I changed the radius size of the rain to look a little bigger.
            I changed the color of the rain.
            I changed from 100 to 10 drops so you won't get dizzy.
		</h5>
        <h3>Above and Beyond</h3>
		<h5>
			I researched different animations online and was able to find examples for rainbow, clouds, and rain. The code for these 
            animations were pretty advanced compared to what I learned in class, but I was able to study the code and find places
            where I could make changes to make it fit my proposal. It was challenging and fun.
